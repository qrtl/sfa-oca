This module enhances the sales order process by adding a delivery_lead_time that is
determined based on the most closely matching lead time profile.
This time is then incorporated into the customer_lead of each sale order line,
optimizing delivery scheduling based on specific lead time configurations.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you must first properly set up your lead time profiles:

1. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*. Find the section Delivery Lead Time
   Settings, and update the factors of warehouse, country, state and partner according
   to your specific requirements. Setting 0.0 means that matches of the corresponding
   field will not be counted in score calculation of the lead time profile.
2. Navigate to *Inventory > Configuration > Lead Time Profiles*, and create records
   according to the reality of delivery logistics.

Example of how most matched lead time profile is determined:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When there are lead time profile records like this, and you have an order to deliver
from Main WH to Cust A:

+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+
| Country | State | Partner | Warehouse | Lead Time (Days) |
+=========+=======+=========+===========+==================+
| Japan   | Tokyo | Cust A  |           |              3.0 |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+
| Japan   | Tokyo |         | Main WH   |              5.0 |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+
| Japan   | Tokyo |         | 2nd WH    |              7.0 |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+

If the factors are configured to be like this:

- Country: 1.0
- State: 1.0
- Partner: 1.0
- Warehouse: 2.0

The scores of each profile will be calculated as follows:

+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+
| Country | State | Partner | Warehouse | Lead Time (Days) | Score Calculation             |
+=========+=======+=========+===========+==================+===============================+
| Japan   | Tokyo | Cust A  |           |              3.0 | 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = 3.0   |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+
| Japan   | Tokyo |         | Main WH   |              5.0 | 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 2.0 = 4.0   |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+
| Japan   | Tokyo |         | 2nd WH    |              7.0 | N/A for warehouse mismatch    |
+---------+-------+---------+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------+

The profile with the highest score is considered the best match, and therefore, a
Delivery Lead Time of 5.0 days will be proposed for the sales order.

In a tie-breaking situation, the lead time profile with the lowest lead time will be chosen.

Usage
=====

The system proposes the **Delivery Lead Time** in sales orders (Other Info tab) based on
the most closely matching lead time profile, determined by the warehouse and delivery
address.

The **Delivery Lead Time** can be manually updated as necessary.

The **Delivery Lead Time** is incorporated into the lead time of each sales order line
by adding days to the lead time proposed based on the standard logic, which governs
delivery scheduling.

Example:
~~~~~~~~

Assume the **Sales Security Lead Time** is set to 2.0 days.

In vanilla Odoo, for a sales order with the following details:

- **Order Date**: 2025-01-19 18:00
- **Order Line Lead Time**: 5.0 days

The delivery order dates would be:

- **Scheduled Date**: 2025-01-22 18:00
- **Deadline**: 2025-01-24 18:00:00

If this module is installed and the **Delivery Lead Time** proposed is 3.0 days, the
values will be updated as follows:

- **Order Line Lead Time**: 8.0 days
- **Deadline (Delivery)**: 2025-01-27 18:00

The **Scheduled Date** will remain unchanged.
