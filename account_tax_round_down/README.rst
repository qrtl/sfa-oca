Use Cases / Context
===================

By default, Odoo uses the "HALF-UP" method to round tax amounts.
However, in some regions, such as Japan, some industries have a common
practice of rounding down instead. This module accommodates such local
conventions by offering an alternate rounding method.

Configuration
=============

Go to *Accounting (or Invoicing) > Configuration > Settings*, and select
"Round-down Tax Amounts" for companies whose tax amounts should be
rounded down.

Usage
=====

With the round-down setting enabled, if you create an invoice in JPY
with the following line:

-  Quantity: 1
-  Unit Price: 15
-  Tax: 10% (excluded)

the calculated tax amount will be 1 instead of 2.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Due to the structure of the compute_all() method in the tax model,
rounding down may not yield the expected results in cases where
tax-inclusive pricing is used.
